The project is a web application built with React and Next.js that interacts with the Cardano Blockfrost API to retrieve and display cryptocurrency wallet information and NFT assets. 
Users input a wallet address, and the app shows transaction details (received and sent funds) or a list of NFT assets with pagination.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

bun dev![Cardano Wallet_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/173a5b31-0936-4890-b91d-a13406133f14)
![Cardano Wallet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3321a73f-cda2-4b68-9f85-1c49229fef21)

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
